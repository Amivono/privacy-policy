We are currently building a website to which we need a Privacy Policy. So I
did browse around internet to see what's in others sites policies. That when
I found Automattics policy, and that they had available under a Crative Commons
sharealike license. So I decided to "fork" their policy, rewrite it to fit our
website and than share that together we this Automatics orginal.

To quote Automattic

        Note, we’ve decided to make this privacy policy available
        under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, which means you’re more than
        welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to
        replace references to us with ones to you, and if you want we’d appreciate
        a link to Automattic.com somewhere on your site. We spent a lot of money and
        time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same.)

We totally share thease ideas.
