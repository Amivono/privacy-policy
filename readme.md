We at Amivono are currently building a website to which we need a Privacy Policy. So I
did browse around Internet to see what's in others sites policies. That's when
I found Automattics policy, and that they had it available under a Crative Commons
Sharealike license. So I decided to "fork" their policy, rewrite it to fit our
website, translate it into Swedish and than share it together we Automattic's
orginal version.

To quote Automattic

    Note, we’ve decided to make this privacy policy available
    under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, which means you’re more than
    welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use, just make sure to
    replace references to us with ones to you, and if you want we’d appreciate
    a link to Automattic.com somewhere on your site. We spent a lot of money and
    time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same.)

I totally share thease ideas, and a link to amivono.com would also be nice.
